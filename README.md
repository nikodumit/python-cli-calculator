# Multi-functional Python Calculator

This is my first mini-project! It's a simple, multi-functional calculator that I built to learn the basics of Python and Git.

### Available Operations:
* **Basic:** Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division
* **Advanced:** Powers (`**`) and Square Roots (`sqrt(x)`)

### How to run:
1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. Run `python calc.py` in your terminal.

### How to use:
1. Enter the first number.
2. Enter an operation: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `**`, or `sqrt(x)`.
3. If you chose anything except `sqrt(x)`, enter the second number.
4. To quit, type `q` or `quit` when it asks for the operation.
